                    The Service may make available listings, descriptions and images of goods or services or related coupons or discounts (collectively, “Products”), as well as references and links to Products. Such Products may be made available by Circolo or by third parties, and may be made available for any purpose, including general information purposes.

We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity or timeliness of such listings, descriptions or images (including any features, specifications and prices contained therein). Such information and the availability of any Product (including the validity of any coupon or discount) are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are for convenience only.

                    <strong>Transactions</strong>
                    . We may make available the ability to purchase or otherwise obtain certain Products through the Service (a “
                    <strong>Transaction</strong>
                    ”). If you wish to make a Transaction, you may be asked to supply certain relevant information, such as your credit card number and its expiration date, your billing address and your shipping information. You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card that you submit in connection with a Transaction. By submitting such information, you grant to us the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating Transactions. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction. By making a Transaction, you represent that the applicable Products will be used only in a lawful manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Circolo reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue making available any Product; to impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, discount or similar promotion; to bar any user from making any Transaction; and to refuse to provide any user with any Product. Refunds and exchanges will be subject to Circolo’s applicable refund and exchange policies. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or on your behalf through the Service, at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred, including all shipping and handling charges. In addition, you are responsible for any taxes applicable to your Transactions. While it is our practice to confirm orders by e-mail, the receipt of an e-mail order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Products will be shipped to an address designated by you, if applicable, so long as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the Service. All Transactions are made pursuant to a shipment contract and, as a result, risk of loss and title for Products pass to you upon delivery of the Products to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.

                    <strong>Memberships</strong>
                    . Certain features, content, functionalities and other aspects of the Services may be available only through a program (the “
                    <strong>Membership</strong>
                    Program”) for users with a valid membership.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each membership is associated only with a single household, and cannot be used to enable any benefits of the Membership Program on any Circolo Mirror outside of your household. Please note that multiple residences that you maintain for your own personal use are considered a single household. A membership may permit the member to create and manage additional user accounts, solely for family members and personal guests of the member, that are permitted to use the benefits of the Membership Program on any Circolo Mirror associated with a valid membership (“
                    <strong>Additional Users</strong>
                    ”). Each Additional User must accept the terms and conditions of these Terms prior to using the Service, and the member will be responsible for all acts and omissions of each Additional User under the membership.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Circolo reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to exclude any individual(s) from the Membership Program or to terminate any membership, for any reason, including abuse of the Membership Program, failure to comply with these Terms, or fraud, misrepresentation or other conduct detrimental to the interests of Circolo. Any such exclusion or termination may affect eligibility for further participation in the Membership Program.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Please note that if your membership expires or is cancelled or terminated, you and any Additional Users may no longer have access to any data, information or other content (including historical data, usage records, custom workouts, etc.) associated with your membership.

                    <strong>Billing and Cancellation.</strong>
                    &nbsp; The fee for the Membership Program (the “
                    <strong>Membership Fee</strong>
                    ”) is the amount currently identified at 
                    <a title="https://www.circolo.us/" href="https://www.circolo.us/">https://www.circolo.us/</a>
                    , plus any applicable taxes, and is non-refundable. Circolo may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change the Membership Fee from time to time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A Service Cycle is one month. Your monthly service cycle begins on the day of your hardware delivery. Your billing is monthly and begins on the day of purchase.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To avoid recurring charge (or obtain refund if charge already happened) for a service cycle, users need to cancel the membership before that service cycle starts.  If you wish to cancel your membership, you may contact our Customer Care team 
                    <a title="support@circolo.us" href="mailto:%20support@circolo.us">support@circolo.us</a>
                    . Please contact our Customer Care team at least one and no more than 30 days prior to your desired last day of service.

                    All memberships in the Membership Program are final. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, any paid Membership Fees (or payable Membership Fees for the remainder of an existing membership term) are non-cancellable and non-refundable. If you decide to cancel your membership, your membership will automatically expire at the end of your then-current membership service cycle. For example, if you cancel your membership in the middle of a monthly service cycle, your membership will continue until the end of that service cycle. If billing for your next service cycle has already occurred when you cancelled your membership during your current service cycle, you may request a refund of membership fee for your next service cycle.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship between you and Circolo, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Circolo and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.

                    <br>
                    The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by these Terms. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at

                    . The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

                    <strong>Apple-Specific Terms.</strong>
                    In addition to your agreement with the foregoing terms and conditions, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the following provisions apply with respect to your use of any version of the App compatible with the iOS operating system of Apple Inc. (“
                    <strong>Apple</strong>
                    ”). Apple is not a party to these Terms and does not own and is not responsible for the App. Apple is not providing any warranty for the App except, if applicable, to refund the purchase price for it. Apple is not responsible for maintenance or other support services for the App and shall not be responsible for any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses with respect to the App, including any third-party product liability claims, claims that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to Circolo in accordance with the “Information or Complaints” section above. The license you have been granted herein is limited to a non-transferable license to use the App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service, except that the App may also be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via Apple’s Family Sharing or volume purchasing programs. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you when using the App, such as your wireless data service agreement. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, Circolo’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver or settlement under these Terms is not subject to the consent of any third party.
